# Capston-2-FINAL
This is my capstone 2 Final 


In this read ME   presents a data PowerPoint  of my project on A/B testing.   To select the data, I had to choose is between two different data spreadsheets on the fuel economy for 2018 or house prices in 2018.  After researching the topics and related data the decision was made to go with the fuel economy datasheet.  The reason I felt more comfortable with the fuel the economy than the housing because it had a real-life connection.  I drive and I’m always complaining about gas prices. Also, I’m currently staying at my parents so I’m not looking for a house right now.


   I had a week to finish this project and come up with three different hypotheses. I had to either reject the null or see if the null is right. I came up with about 8 different ideas even though I only needed 3 because I knew some of them would be rejected and the math, and the null wouldn’t be correct.  Finally, with 3 different hypothesis it was time to convert my data into visualization through PowerPoint . First step was to make all the numbers and put them in graphs.  I had to use pivot charts and make my numbers into visual graphs and charts so people who don’t have a statistical background and having a graphs and pictures make it easier for the audience and the eyes. 
  
  Lastly everything was coming along together it was time to present. I had to get ready for Q&A along with being prepared for any uncertainty like power outages, computer crashing, or any accidental mishaps I had to be prepared for it. I did practice runs with my parents and sister while also taking in some their feedbacks and used it to fix anything that needed fixing. It was finally completed, I turned it in, and I presented it to my Interviewer, and he enjoyed it, asked me questions I gave him answers to each of them without a stumble.  I got my review back and found out I passed I was ecstatic, and I couldn’t believe it I knew that the sky is the limit from here for me and I’m excited for what my future holds.
